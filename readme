# CampbellDataStreaming
## Description
- A system allowing data collection from a Campbell scientific datalogger using
  a BeagleBone Black and Python, and automatically streaming data statistics to plot.ly.

## Requirements:
- BeagleBone Black running Debian Jessie
- Internet Connection (I'm using a GSM Modem)
- UART4 RS232 cape

## To Do:
   - How to collect data such that it isn't graphed faster than it's collected. (overwrite collected file)
   - Either that, or keep index of last row read, and start from there on next iteration. (append to collected file)

## To start logging:
1. Clone repo
2. Run DataCollection/setup.sh as sudo

## Folder Layout:
   -DataCollection <- Forked from CampbellDataCollection repository
   -Streaming      <- Contains data streaming code
